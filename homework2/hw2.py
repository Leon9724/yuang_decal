# 1) Suppose your current working directory is ~/Desktop/classes/python_decal/. What command would allow you to navigate directly to ~/Desktop?
cd ~/Desktop/
# 2) What does ~/ mean?
it mean my home directory 
# 3) What's the difference between and abolute and a relative path in your terminal?
absolute path is the full path of a file. eg. cd /c/Users/username/Desktop
relative path is a shorter and faster way to find a file. eg. cd homework2
# 4) What command would bring you back to your home directory?
cd ~
# 5) If you called rm ./ in your current working directory, what would it do? 
it deletes all files in the current directory.

# 6) In your current working directory, what does calling "git add" do? What about "git commit"? What about "git push"?
git add moves files from current directory to staging area.
git commit saves changes to local repository
git push pushes changes from local to remote repository

# 7) Let's say you call "git add" in your current working directory and then "git status". What message would appear? What is it telling you?
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   hello.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .vscode/
        homework2/hw2.py
It tells me the txt file is in staging area.

# 8) What has been the most frustrating error or bug you've encountered in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot and resolve it?
when typing in vscode, if I wanna change or insert a text in the middle of a phrase, the cursor would delete the next letter and I have to redo everything after that.
Solved by turning off overtype
# 9) How does cloning a repository differ from pulling from a repository?
cloning is copying a remote repo to my pc, but pulling is downloading changes from remote repo to local.

I used to learn a little bit of python, but I forgot most of it.
